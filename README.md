## Simplification for Visualization purposes of the flow-based domain between two borders.

### Next Steps to assess the impact of new planned power lines on the flow based domain:
- Simulate the complete blow based domain
- Simulate multiple days and extract a typical flow based domain for each border
- Use PyPSA to simulate the European Electricity System including TYNDP planned new infrastructure.
- Extract the PTDF matrix and simulate a typical flow based domain of the planned power system
